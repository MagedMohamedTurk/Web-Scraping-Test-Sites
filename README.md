# Web-Scraping-Test-Sites
## Description
Selenium-Python was used in this project to scrape data from https://webscraper.io/  
The 'Test Sites' tab of the site resources lets you practice your scraping skills in a legal and safe way.  
This project scrapes the 'https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/static'  
Here, the challenge was to handle pagination links when scraping all products.  
## Technique
In this project, I tried to present a proper approach to the scraping problem. Using predefined functions and the Tqdm package to track time is extremely valuable in your professional work.
